# Airbnb Data Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview
This project explores Airbnb data from five major U.S. cities: New York, Boston, Seattle, Hawaii, and San Francisco. The goal is to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in short-term rental markets to drive business insights for real estate and tourism.

## Dataset
We used two datasets from Airbnb:
- Listings: Contains detailed information about each property
- Reviews: Includes guest comments on various properties

Data source: [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)
